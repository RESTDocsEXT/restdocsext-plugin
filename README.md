RESTDocsEXT Plugins
===================

This project will consist of plugins for build systems like Maven and Gradle,
that will help to generate the configuration file required for the [restdocsext-ui][1].
Along with the plugins, will be a [Spring REST Docs][2] snippet to help in producing
configuration data from unit tests.
