== Create a Team

This endpoint allows for the creation of a new team.

=== cURL Request

include::{snippets}/create-a-team/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Request Fields

include::{snippets}/create-a-team/request-fields.adoc[]

Note that when creating a new team, an id _MUST NOT_ be sent with the request. A null value _MAY_ be sent (but not necessary). In the event an id _is_ sent, a client error response status will be sent back.

Upon sucessful creation, a `Location` header will be sent back, specifiying the newly created URI for the team.
